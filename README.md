We model a percolation system using an N-by-N grid of sites. Each site is either open or blocked. A full site is
an open site that can be connected to an open site in the top row via a chain of neighboring (left, right, up, down) open sites.
We say the system percolates if there is a full site in the bottom row. In other words, a system percolates if we fill all open
sites connected to the top row and that process fills some open site on the bottom row. For the insulating/metallic materials
example, the open sites correspond to metallic materials, so that a system that percolates has a metallic path from top to
bottom, with full sites conducting. For the porous substance example, the open sites correspond to empty space through
which water might flow, so that a system that percolates lets water fill open sites, flowing from top to bottom.
